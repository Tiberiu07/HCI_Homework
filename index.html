      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        The Bachelor Thesis project is a very important academic endeavour for every student. Therefore, it goes without saying
        that the user experience has to be taken into consideration while developing the application. A usable and 
        intuitive user interface I would consider to be the bare-minimum standard for such a complex project. Throughout this 
        article, I will discuss different HCI principles, methods and best practices applied to my Bachelor Thesis software application - 
        InvestoBuddy.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Human Computer Interaction comes from a book in the 80s that was about the psychology of someone interacting with a machine.
        It is all about the aspect of how a person feels when using a particular software product. It does NOT come down only 
        to making things simpler and more intuitive. There is the aspect of graphical design that also comes into play. For example,
        this may be the types of images used to affect people's psychology. As a practical example: some colors may work better for different 
        purposes (for example some are more persuasive or other are more powerful in ways that they create more urgency etc.). Also, 
        typgraphy, sounds, aesthetics could be considered important elements that can effect the human experience. Those who 
        studied and worked in HCI saw it as a crucial instrument to popularize the idea that the interaction between a computer 
        and the user should resemble a human-to-human, open-ended dialogue. “…it no longer makes sense to regard HCI as a specialty 
        of computer science; HCI has grown to be broader, larger and much more diverse than computer science itself“ 
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout this short article, I will cover some important subject areas of Human Computer Interaction, briefly explaining 
        what each and every area is concerned about and give some practical examples on how some of these areas 
        have been / or not applied through my InvestoBuddy project.
        The covered areas will be the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Human Factors</li>
          <li>Design Models, Methodologies and Guidelines.</li>
          <li>
            Information Architecture. Visual Design.
          </li>
          <li>Design Patterns for Social Interactions.</li>

      <h2>Human Factors</h2>
      <p>
        When we are talking about human factors, it is mandatory to mention that currently software products 
        are described by multiple interaction idioms, meaning that users are accustomed to some 
        specific types/styles of user interfaces. Each particular style has its own vocabulary of items, actions,
        sensorial (e.g., visual, auditory) representations. Examples: forms, text editors, web browsers, multimedia players etc.
        Also, besides different types of user interfaces we have to consider that software applicatiosn are also used in different 
        contexts: entertainment & leisure software, media players, social applications, games, smart appliances/home.
        We have to take all these aspects into consideration when designing an application. The first question we have to give ourselves 
        would be: who is the user who will use it? And when we have a prompt answer to this question we have to adapt 
        the mentioned factors to our targeted audience. We have to answer to questions like : who is our primary targeted user?
        But our secondary targeted user? Tertiary users etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes down to the application which I have designed (InvestoBuddy), I tried to take all the mentioned factors into consideration.
        I used familar elements as components of my UI. For example I used typical, intuitive login/register forms or 
        helpful Sidebar to assure that the user experience is at the upmost level of quality. Every decision regarding the UI was taken 
        with the question "How can I enhance the user experience?" in mind. From big, reachable buttons to searchbars and sidebars, I have used all the mentioned factors 
        (items, actions, sensorial representations) to my advantage. My targeted primary user is a highly financially educated person who is interested 
        in areas like bussiness, trading and the stock prices situation as a whole. It is a person who is an adept of continous improvement and education. 
        The application is intuitive because it was developed in a manner to resemble some other familiar financial platforms.

        <h2>Design Models, Methodologies and Guidelines.</h2>
        <p>
          A successful product is a balanced combination of several factors, like Desirability, Viability and Capacity. All these have to be taken into consideration when developing and designing 
          a software product. While Software Engineering is concerned with the communication between application and developers or between teams of developers, Human Computer Interaction is mainly focused on
          the communication with the user. Interface design requires an important development effort. A task-centered design, focused ONLY on the developer's goals can ruin a whole project. At the other end of the spectrum
          developing an app that takes into consideration ONLY user needs and almost never a developer's concern is also a recipe for disaster. This is why making the right choices regarding these aspects is nothing 
          less and nothing more than a well-balanced dance, where all the elements interact flawlessly one with another.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we are talking about InvestoBuddy design, I have tried to balance all the factors very well. My first and foremost concern was the user experience, but I have also considered the ease of implementation 
          when taking particular decisions regarding using certain components in the design. For example, when designing the sidebar I wanted in the first version of the design to add a particular animation to the header text 
          to enhance the user visual experience. But from an implementation perspective, I came to the conclusion that this would be a pretty bad idea, because it is hard to implement an animation, but add little value to the project. 
          In contrast, I never wanted to add a search bar for the stocks, but I eventually came to the conclusion that this would be an important element that will enhance the user experience. This is why I consider that developing a 
          good and useful software product is a well-balanced dance.

        <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          The essential problem that designers are dealing with is that information should be properly structured
          and presented in order to be easily perceived and consumed by users. Information architecture is the practice of
          deciding how to arrange the parts of something to be understandable. This is achieved through using
          hierarchies, categorizations, navigation, and metadata for a (digital) product such as an application or Web site.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my InvestoBuddy bachelor thesis application, the information architecture aspect was taken as seriously as possible. It is essential 
          for a user to be able to visualise stock price information data in a clear and coherent way. Because when we are talking about financial aspects,
          each details matters. This is why besides the market price for a particular stock I have included data such as a graph that presents the evolution of the price 
          during different time intervals, such as 1 day, 1 week, 1 month etc. I took all the measures to present the stocks data in a clear way. And I believe this is an important 
          step towards developing a quality software application because a proper information architecture enhances the user experience.

        <h2>Design Patterns for Social Interactions.</h2>
        <p>
          Microinteractions are also a details to be taken into consideration when developing a software product. Because each detail matters when it comes to user experience. And tiny details 
          like changing the color when a password becomes valid really can make the difference. I will mention some of the most important design patterns concerning web and mobile applications:
          Safe Exploration (Let me explore without getting lost or getting into trouble), Instant gratification (I want to accomplish something now, not later), Satisficing (This is good enough. 
          I don’t want to spend more time learning to do it better). Changes in midstream (I changed my mind about what I was doing), 
          Deferred choices (I don’t want to answer that now; just let me finish), Incremental Construction (Let me change this. That doesn’t look right; let me change it again. That’s better!) and others..
        </p>
        <p>
          When I designed InvestoBuddy, I took into consideration also some popular design patterns. For example, when it comes to Safe Exploration, I implemented a SideBar that lets the user easily navigate between 
          application screens without getting lost or getting into trouble. Also, with this design pattern in mind, I've implemented the SearchBar to facilitate the process of finding particular stock actions. If we are talking about 
          Instant Gratification, I instantly provide feedback when a user enters his login credentials. (success or failure). If we are talking about the Satisficing design pattern, I implemented the "Instrumente Financiare" page in such a way that 
          if a user does not need any other information than the stock price and graph financial details, he does not have to scroll all the way down for more detailed info (which is still easily available). Incremental Construction -> the user has the possibility
          of incrementally building his list of following companies in a way that he desires. Habituation -> the user has similar interactive buttons throughout all the application etc.  These are the main design patterns used throughout my application.

          <p>
            As some concluding remarks for this article, I will mention that thinking in terms of user needs is an art. A practical example would the the terrible success of the Amazon company, which has as its core, most important priciple the one to obssess about customer needs. 
            This shows us how important it is to always develop and design user-focused applications.
